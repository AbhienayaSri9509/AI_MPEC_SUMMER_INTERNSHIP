**Week 4 Project â€” Movie User Taste Clustering**
**Objective**
To analyze movie user preferences and group users into clusters based on their viewing tastes. This enables personalized movie recommendations and better understanding of user behavior.

Dataset
User-movie rating data (e.g., MovieLens dataset or custom user ratings matrix).

**Approach and Techniques Used**
Data Preparation: Created a user-movie rating matrix from raw data.

Similarity Measurement: Calculated similarity between users using cosine similarity.

Clustering: Applied K-Means clustering algorithm to group users with similar movie tastes.

Visualization: Used plots to visualize clusters and user distribution.

**Outcome**
Identified distinct user clusters such as action lovers, romantic movie fans, and comedy watchers.

Insights help in building personalized recommendation systems tailored to user preferences.

**Tools and Technologies**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
