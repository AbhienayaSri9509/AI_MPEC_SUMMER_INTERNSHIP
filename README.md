## üìÖ WEEK 2: Cost of Living vs Average Salary

### üìå Objective:
To compare the cost of living and average income across major cities and evaluate where living is affordable.

### üìä Dataset:
- `cost_living_data.csv`

### üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Used:
- Data preprocessing
- Normalization and indexing of cost/salary
- Scatter plots and city-level ranking
- Country-wise aggregation

### üìå Outcome:
Created a ranked comparison of cities based on salary-to-cost ratio, helping identify affordable living locations worldwide.

## üìÖ WEEK 4: Movie User Taste Clustering

### üìå Objective:
To group movie users based on their preferences and viewing history.

### üìä Dataset:
- MovieLens or custom movie-user preference matrix

### üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Used:
- Cosine similarity
- K-Means clustering
- User-movie rating matrix
- Cluster visualization

### üìå Outcome:
Users were clustered into taste groups (e.g., Action Lovers, Romantic Movie Fans, Comedy Watchers), enabling personalized recommendation strategies.

## üìÖ WEEK 5: Alcohol Speech Detection Using Audio Classification

### üìå Objective:
To classify whether a person is under the influence of alcohol based on their speech patterns using audio feature extraction and supervised machine learning techniques.

### üìä Dataset:
- `alcohol_speech_data.csv` or extracted features from real-time audio recordings

### üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Used:
- **Audio Preprocessing:**
  - Noise filtering and normalization
  - Audio segmentation and feature extraction using:
    - MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
    - Chroma Frequencies
    - Zero-Crossing Rate
    - Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE)
- **Model Training:**
  - Train-test split
  - Algorithms: Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression
  - Evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- **Visualization:**
  - MFCC spectrograms
  - Confusion matrix plots
  - Feature importance charts

### üìå Outcome:
Built a reliable classifier to distinguish between sober and intoxicated speech patterns with strong accuracy. Demonstrated real-world application potential for safety monitoring, healthcare assessments, and DUI prevention systems.

#### üìñWEEK 6 FINAL PROJECT : Fraud Detection with CTGAN

## üìå Overview

This project demonstrates how CTGAN (Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network) can be used to generate synthetic transaction data for fraud detection tasks.
CTGAN helps in handling imbalanced datasets by creating realistic synthetic fraud samples, improving model training for rare-event classification problems.

## üéØ Objectives

Generate synthetic fraudulent transaction data to balance the dataset.

Improve fraud detection model performance using augmented data.

Showcase a complete data preprocessing ‚Üí generation ‚Üí model training ‚Üí evaluation pipeline.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Python (>=3.8)

Pandas, NumPy ‚Äì Data processing

scikit-learn ‚Äì ML models & evaluation

ctgan ‚Äì Synthetic data generation

Matplotlib, Seaborn ‚Äì Data visualization


## üìä Dataset

We use a credit card transactions dataset (e.g., Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset), which is highly imbalanced:

Legitimate transactions: ~99.8%

Fraudulent transactions: ~0.2%

## üîÑ Workflow
Load and preprocess transaction data.

Train CTGAN on fraud-labeled data to generate synthetic samples.

Augment original dataset with synthetic fraud transactions.

Train ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) on the balanced dataset.

Evaluate performance using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## üìà Results

Model	Precision	Recall	F1-Score	ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	0.85	0.72	0.78	0.95
Random Forest	0.91	0.88	0.89	0.98
XGBoost	0.93	0.90	0.91	0.99

CTGAN-based data augmentation significantly improves recall while maintaining high precision.

**‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run**
