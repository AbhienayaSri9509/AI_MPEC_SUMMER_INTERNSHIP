## 📅 WEEK 1: Healthcare Cost Analysis by Country

### 📌 Objective:
To analyze global healthcare expenditure and uncover trends across different countries.

### 📊 Dataset:
- `Life Expectancy Data.xls` (from WHO / World Bank)

### 🛠️ Techniques Used:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis between life expectancy and health spending
- Visualization using matplotlib/seaborn

### 📌 Outcome:
Identified countries with the highest and lowest healthcare spending, discovered how it relates to life expectancy, and visualized key insights using graphs.

## 📅 WEEK 2: Cost of Living vs Average Salary

### 📌 Objective:
To compare the cost of living and average income across major cities and evaluate where living is affordable.

### 📊 Dataset:
- `cost_living_data.csv`

### 🛠️ Techniques Used:
- Data preprocessing
- Normalization and indexing of cost/salary
- Scatter plots and city-level ranking
- Country-wise aggregation

### 📌 Outcome:
Created a ranked comparison of cities based on salary-to-cost ratio, helping identify affordable living locations worldwide.

## 📅 WEEK 3: Segmenting Credit Card Users

### 📌 Objective:
To apply unsupervised learning to group credit card users based on their spending behavior and profile.

### 📊 Dataset:
- `Credit Card Dataset.csv`

### 🛠️ Techniques Used:
- K-Means clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- Customer segmentation based on spending categories
- Visualization of clusters

### 📌 Outcome:
Successfully segmented users into meaningful groups (e.g., high spenders, low balance holders, etc.), which can help in targeted marketing and financial strategy planning.

## 📅 WEEK 4: Movie User Taste Clustering

### 📌 Objective:
To group movie users based on their preferences and viewing history.

### 📊 Dataset:
- MovieLens or custom movie-user preference matrix

### 🛠️ Techniques Used:
- Cosine similarity
- K-Means clustering
- User-movie rating matrix
- Cluster visualization

### 📌 Outcome:
Users were clustered into taste groups (e.g., Action Lovers, Romantic Movie Fans, Comedy Watchers), enabling personalized recommendation strategies.

## 📅 WEEK 5: Alcohol Speech Detection Using Audio Classification

### 📌 Objective:
To classify whether a person is under the influence of alcohol based on their speech patterns using audio feature extraction and supervised machine learning techniques.

### 📊 Dataset:
- `alcohol_speech_data.csv` or extracted features from real-time audio recordings

### 🛠️ Techniques Used:
- **Audio Preprocessing:**
  - Noise filtering and normalization
  - Audio segmentation and feature extraction using:
    - MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
    - Chroma Frequencies
    - Zero-Crossing Rate
    - Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE)
- **Model Training:**
  - Train-test split
  - Algorithms: Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression
  - Evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- **Visualization:**
  - MFCC spectrograms
  - Confusion matrix plots
  - Feature importance charts

### 📌 Outcome:
Built a reliable classifier to distinguish between sober and intoxicated speech patterns with strong accuracy. Demonstrated real-world application potential for safety monitoring, healthcare assessments, and DUI prevention systems.
