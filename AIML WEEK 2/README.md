cost_living_data.csv — contains city-wise data on living costs (housing, food, transportation, etc.) and average salaries.

**Approach and Techniques Used**
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and normalized data for consistent comparison.

Data Analysis: Calculated salary-to-cost ratios to evaluate affordability.

Visualization: Used bar charts and scatter plots to visualize relationships between average salaries and living costs by city and country.

Insights: Identified cities with high salaries but also high costs and cities where lower salaries are balanced by lower living expenses.

**Outcome**
Ranked cities based on affordability using the salary-to-cost ratio.

Highlighted countries where residents enjoy a better quality of life relative to income.

Provided a clear picture of how cost of living impacts economic well-being.
